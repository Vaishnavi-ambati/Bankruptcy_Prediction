Summary:

Bankruptcy prediction is the task of predicting bankruptcy and various measures of financial distress of firms, and is important due to the relevance for creditors and investors in evaluating the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt.

The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric parameters which allow foreseeing the financial condition of a firm. In this project we document our observations as we explore, build, and compare, some of the widely used classification models:

Random Forests
Extreme Gradient Boosting
Balanced Bagging
I have chosen the Polish companiesâ€™ bankruptcy data set where synthetic features were used to reflect higher-order statistics.
